  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>
    The Flying V is very recognizable for its bold, V-shaped body. It's built with sharp angles and clean lines that give it a futuristic and aggressive look.
    Often finished in classic white, black, or natural wood, it stands out on any stage. The design isn’t just eye-catching—it’s become a symbol of rebellion 
    and individuality in rock music.

  <h2>Sound</h2>
  <p>
    Even though it looks wild, the Flying V delivers serious tone. Thanks to its solid mahogany body and two powerful humbucker pickups, it produces a strong,
    punchy sound with great sustain. It works well with heavy distortion, making it a favorite for metal and hard rock players. The warm mids and tight lows
    give it a distinct voice that stands out in a band mix.

  <h2>Legends Who Played It</h2>
  <p>
    Over the years, some of music’s biggest names have picked up the Flying V. Blues legend Albert King made it part of his signature style, playing it upside
    down because he was left-handed. Jimi Hendrix also played a custom Flying V during several live shows. In the world of hard rock and metal, Michael Schenker
    of UFO and Rudolf Schenker of Scorpions both helped make the Flying V iconic.

  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <p>
    Gibson introduced the Flying V in 1958 as part of a series of modern-looking guitars. It didn’t sell well at first, so the company stopped making it after
    a couple of years. But by the late 1960s and 1970s, guitarists started to appreciate its unique shape and powerful tone. It quickly became popular with rock
    and metal players, eventually earning its place as a legendary model in Gibson’s lineup.
