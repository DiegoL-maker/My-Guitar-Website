  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    The Gibson Les Paul was first released in the early 1950s and was named after Les Paul, a famous guitarist and inventor who helped create it.
    At the time, Gibson wanted to compete with Fender’s solid-body guitars, and the Les Paul was their answer. It started out with a gold finish
    and later introduced the iconic sunburst models that are now highly collectible. Over the decades, the Les Paul became a symbol of rock music
    and is still one of Gibson’s most popular guitars.

  <h2>Tone</h2>
  <p>
    The Les Paul is known for its thick, powerful tone. It has a solid mahogany body and usually two humbucker pickups, which give it a warm,
    rich sound with lots of sustain. This makes it great for heavy rock, blues, and even metal. Compared to other guitars, the Les Paul has a
    deeper, more full-bodied sound that really cuts through in a band mix. Its tone is one of the reasons so many guitarists choose it for both
    rhythm and lead playing.

    names who have helped make the Les Paul legendary. The guitar’s look, tone, and feel make it a favorite among pros.

    The Gibson Les Paul has a classic, elegant design. It has a single-cutaway body that gives easy access to higher frets, and a carved maple top that often
